    <h2>SUBSTANCE ABUSE </h2>

    <h3>Millions of Americans are addicted to alcohol and drugs. In order to properlytreat substance abuse, it is critical to identify the addiction and create a plan ofaction to combat it. Effective drug monitoring is crucial to formulate the right plan of care and take the first step to rehabilitation and prevent further disease and complications.</h3>

      monitor and eliminate any type of substance abuse. Wemake it easy for you to test your patient population, receive results and handle any questions or concerns you may have. Our professional staff has years of experience and promises to exceed your expectations.</h3>

    <h4>Quantitative Urine Analysis (QUA) Scope-Of-Benefits</h4>

    <h3>The fact remains; the burgeoning and exponential growth of pain management clinics has directly fostered the illegal dissemination of highly addictive prescription medication via patient diversion. Consequently, this ubiquitous diversion, which is non-discriminative of age or race, is devastating and destroying lives and families, not to mention, increasing the incidence of overdoses. This accelerated diversion has created significant challenges for the DEA, as their resources are unmatched relative to the rampant diversion.
      By way of background, if a physician utilizes the QUA test (determines the level of medication ingested), and the patient diverts their prescription medication, the physician would become overtly aware of this potential diversion. Under this circumstance, the physician would be prohibited from writing another prescription for said patient, thereby voiding additional prescriptions anddrug-diversion.
      Conversely, absent QUA, the physician would be unaware of a potential diversion as qualitative urine tests are unable to detect specific levels. Therefore, the physician would continue to write prescriptions for said patient, thereby unknowingly perpetuating the
      drug-diversion.Clearly, the superior QUA (a) aids the DEA in their fight against illegal distribution of prescription medication by <br>
      significantly mitigating the origin of diversion, (b) assuages the horrific influence drug-diversion casts on families and
      society-in-general, and (c) financially preserves the bottom-line of insurance companies via the reduction of (i) unnecessary payments for prescription medications, (ii) medical costs associated with addiction and overdoses, and (iii) the inherent and overall systemic costs associated with the foregoing peripherals. An additional segment of diversion concern is the insidious population of Ritalin / Adderall. These prescriptions have evolved as the drug-of-choice within the high school and college demographics. Once again, the superior diversion solution is QUA. In conclusion, NLMS offers a determinant solution via QUA. A vigilant perspective must be applied in an effort to abate the foregoing issues. To thatend, NLMS advocates the objectively empirical and pragmatic approach of QUA.

  <h4>Physician / Practice Benefits</h4>
  <h3>The diversion epidemic has translated into jeopardy for the physician administrating pain and physic medications, as the DEA ' s sights have turned to the prescribing source of said medications. Essentially, the physicians not conducting QUA are exposed to DEA charges encompassing complicit drug distribution - whereas QUA immunes the physician from such prosecution.</h3>
