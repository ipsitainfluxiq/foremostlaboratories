    <h2>Why is it important to monitor abuse of controlled substances
      while providing the right care for your pain patients?</h2>

    <h3>Prescription medications are necessary to run a practice effectively and providing the right treatment plan is vital
      to your practice. With prescription drug abuse on the rise, physicians must take action to mitigate risk of running a
      practice that is highly dependent on controlled substances. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor medication
      compliance within your practice population. Foremost Laboratories can be your key partner to monitor and ensure patient compliance. We offer an easy drug-monitoring program that is accurate and allows you to focus on quality care. Our low detection levels allow you to see what drugs your patients are taking.</h3>
