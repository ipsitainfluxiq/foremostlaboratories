    <h2>The Pharmacogenetic Test</h2>
    <h3>As you probably know, your patients differ in their response to drugs. Traditional medicine employs a trial and error approach, but pharmacogenetic testing applies

        DNA technology to offer specific guidance about medications that work best for your patients based on their DNA. A simple cheek swab can reveal which medications may
        cause side effects or even dangerous adverse reactions â€“ the cause of
        more than 100,000 deaths in the U.S. each year.</h3>
