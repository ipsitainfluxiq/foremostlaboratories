        Panel. To prepare for the wellness blood test, fasting for 10-12 hours prior to collection is recommended, and drinking water and taking your medications prior to testing is
        recommended. Test results will typically be available in 1-2 days.</div>

    <h2>COMPREHENSIVE METABOLIC PANEL (14 TESTS):</h2>

       <p> <span>Glucose:</span> The glucose test identifies blood sugar levels, the most direct way to not only discover diabetes, but to evaluate options for controlling thedisease as well.</p>

        <p><span> Uric Acid:</span> The uric acid test measures the amount of uric acid found in a blood sample. Uric acid is produced in two ways, from digesting food you eat and from the natural  breakdown of your body’s cells.</p>



        <h3>KIDNEY PROFILE</h3>

        <p> <span>BUN or Urea Nitrogen:</span> Indicates kidney function by measuring the by-prod- uct of protein metabolism
            eliminated through the kidneys.</p>

        <p><span>Creatinine, Serum:</span> Indicates kidney function. BUN/Creatinine Ratio: Provides assessment of kidney function
            by dividingthe BUN by the Creatinine.</p>


        <p><span>Glomerular Filtration (eGFR):</span>Provides an assessment of the kidney’s filtering capacity.</p>

        <p><span>Uric Acid: </span>Another by-product of protein metabolism eliminated through the kidneys. Uric acid is also an indicator of
            kidney function</p>

        <p><span> Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST or SGOT): </span> An enzyme found in liver, heart muscle, skeletal and other organs.
        Abnormalities in concentration lev- els may indicate liver disease.</p>

        <p><span> Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT): </span> An enzyme found mainly in the liver. Abnormalities may indicate liver
        disease.</p>

        <p><span> Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH):  </span>An enzyme found mostly in the heart, mus-cles, liver, kidney, brain, and red blood
        cells. When an organ of the body is damaged, LDH is released in greater quantity into the bloodstream.</p>

        <p><span>  GGT: </span> Also known as Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, GGTP Formal name: Gamma-glutamyl transferase helps to
        detect liver and bile duct injury. Some doctors use it in all people they suspect of having liver disease, others use
        it only to help explain the cause of other changes or if they suspect alcohol abuse.</p>

            and the electrical ac- tivity of muscles and nerves.</li>

            <li> <span>Potassium:</span> Helps control the muscles and nerves.Chloride Serum: Helps ensure electrolyte

       <p> <span>Cholesterol, Total:</span> A sterol in the blood used to assess heart health. Know- ing your cholesterol level is just as
        essential as knowing your blood pressure. High cholesterol levels often indicate an increased risk of coronary heart
        disease.</p>

        <p><span> Triglycerides:</span> Fat in the blood, responsible for providing energy to the body’s cells. Triglycerides should remain less than 400 mg/dl even when the body is in a non-fasting state.</p>

        <p> <span>HDL Cholesterol:</span> High-density lipoproteins, or “good” cholesterol, take cho- lesterol away from the cells and
        transport it back to the liver for removal or processing. Low HDL can result from a lack of exercise and smoking, while
        people with high levels of HDL may have lower chances of heart disease.</p>

        <p><span>LDL Cholesterol:</span> Low-density lipoproteins (calculation); or “bad” choles- terol, contain the highest percentage of
        cholesterol and are thought of as responsible for depositing cholesterol on the artery walls.</p>

        <p> <span>Total Cholesterol/HDL Ratio:</span> This ratio is calculated by dividing the total cholesterol by the HDL cholesterol, and is used by healthcare professionals to determine your relative risk for developing heart disease.</p>

    <strong>THYROID PANEL WITH THYROID-STIMULATING HORMONE (TSH)</strong>
    <br/>

    The thyroid gland synthesizes, stores and releases hormones. The hor-mones secreted are iodine-containing amino acids, thyroxine (T4) and triio- do-thyronine (T3).
    The thyroid hormones influence a diversity of metabolic processes including weight control, energy level and heart rate. This com- prehensive test helps to evaluate
    thyroid hormones that control the body’s metabolic rate and includes: Total T-4 (Thyroxine), T-3 uptake, Free—Thy-roxine Index (FTI), T-7 and Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH).

    <h2>COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT (CBC) WITH DIFFERENTIAL AND PLATELETS</h2>

    <p>A complete blood count (CBC) provides critical information about the numbers and kinds of cells in the blood, especially platelets, white blood cells and red blood cells. A CBC helps physicians identify the cause of suchsymptoms as
